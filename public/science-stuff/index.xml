      <description>Light is a form of electromagnetic radiation that is visible to the human eye. Light travels in straight lines and has both wave-like and particle-like properties. The effect of light can cause changes in the behavior of electrons.&#xA;It can also transfer energy to electrons and cause them to become more mobile or to change their state. This is what makes a photoresistor function.&#xA;What is a Photoresistor? A photoresistor, also known as a light-dependent resistor (LDR), is a type of electronic component that can be used to detect light.</description>

      <description>The main difference between a mechanical wave and a transverse wave lies in how the particles in the medium move relative to the direction of the wave&amp;rsquo;s travel.&#xA;What are Mechanical Waves? Mechanical waves are disturbances that propagate through a medium, transferring energy from one point to another without causing any permanent displacement of the medium itself.&#xA;&amp;#x1f4a1;&#xA;Mechanical waves need a medium (like air, water, or a string) to propagate.</description>
