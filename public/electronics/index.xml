      <guid>http://localhost:1313/electronics/how-do-solar-cells-work-to-generate-electricity/</guid>
      <description>The way solar cells work to generate electricity is by absorbing energy from the sun (which constitutes tiny particles called photons).&#xA;This energy from the sun strikes the solar cells thereby resulting in electrons being knocked out from their normal position and then being allowed to move freely, resulting to be the current that flows through our circuits or light bulb at home.&#xA;But there is more physics behind how solar cells work to generate electricity so let’s look into that.</description>

      <description>Programming is important to electrical and electronics engineering (or EEE for short) because EEE is all about problem-solving and these problems are solved using mathematics, physics, and programming (sometimes referred to as coding).&#xA;But what is programming all about? Programming is a skill or tool that is used for commanding or instructing computers or hardware devices to do a specific task most especially those that are repetitive and need precision because a human can&amp;rsquo;t, or those tasks that help to make life easier for us.</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/electronics/what-is-modulation-in-communication-its-types-and-why-we-modulate/</guid>
      <description>Without modulation, it might seem impossible for human to communicate over a long distance. Because when we speak, it get propagated into space and dies out and the information can only be gotten if the person we want to communicate with is close.&#xA;Know that the frequency of human voice is around the range of 20hz to 20Khz which is low and can&amp;rsquo;t travel far. With this in mind, a third party is needed to carry the information over a long distance just as if you throw a piece of paper on the ground, it takes longer to go down because air makes it to float but if you tie a stone to the paper, it goes down quickly.</description>

      <description>Electricity is basically what flows through a wire or a conductor and then power up our light bulb, TV, and other electronic gadgets at home. And it works by letting tiny particles called electrons to flow or move through a conductive closed path.&#xA;In essence, a wire which is a conductor allows those electrons to flow through it resulting in what is called electric current or electricity.&#xA;But to understand what electricity is and how it works on a deeper level, we need to zoom down to zero and understand the physics behind it.</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/electronics/baseband-and-passband-signal-and-their-difference/</guid>
      <description>In communication, baseband signal is the original or natural information (i.e. the information we are interested to send) e.g. voice, image, or video. Baseband is also called the message signal.&#xA;But to carry this baseband signal over a long distance as it has a low frequency, modulation needs to take place. If the baseband or original message is used to modify a carrier wave (i.e. modulation process) then after modulation, the information that is transferred is the passband signal.</description>
