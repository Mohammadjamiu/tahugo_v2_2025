![When Was Electricity Invented?](/images/anthony-indraus-bb9jwutmpuk-unsplash.webp "When Was Electricity Invented?")

Since the beginning of time, **electricity** has been a fundamental form of energy that exists in the universe. 

**Therefore, it was not invented by any individual or group of people, but instead it was discovered through observing and understanding its properties and behavior.** 

**Electricity** has been known to humans for thousands of years, from the observation of lightning strikes to the use of electric eels for medicinal purposes by ancient civilizations.

The term “electricity” was first coined by **William Gilbert**, an English physician and natural philosopher, in 1600. Gilbert was studying the phenomenon of static electricity, which he observed when rubbing certain materials together, such as amber or glass. 

He used the term “electricus,” which means “like amber,” to describe the phenomenon. Later on, the term “electricity” was adopted to describe the entire range of electrical phenomena, including electrical currents, magnetic fields, and electromagnetic radiation.

**Benjamin Franklin**, one of the Founding Fathers of the United States, was also a pioneer in the study of electricity. 

In the mid-1700s, he conducted a series of experiments that helped to establish the principles of electrical charge and demonstrated that lightning is a form of electricity. 

Franklin also invented the lightning rod, which is used to protect buildings from lightning strikes.

**Michael Faraday**, a British scientist, was another important figure in the development of electrical technology. 

In the early 1800s, he made several key discoveries related to electromagnetism, including the principle of electromagnetic induction, which led to the development of the electric generator. 

Faraday's work laid the foundation for the use of electrical power, and he is considered one of the most influential scientists of the 19th century.

With all that has been discussed so far, it can be said that while **electricity was not invented** by any individual, the understanding and exploiting of its properties have been developed through the work of many scientists and inventors over the centuries, including William Gilbert, Benjamin Franklin, and Michael Faraday.
