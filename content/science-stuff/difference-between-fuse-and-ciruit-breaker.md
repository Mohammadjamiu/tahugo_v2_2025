**Fuses and circuit breakers** are both electrical safety devices used to protect electrical circuits from damage or destruction in the event of an overcurrent or short circuit. However, there are some key differences between the two:

## What is a fuse?

A fuse is a type of safety device that works by melting and breaking a circuit when the current through it exceeds a certain limit. Fuses are relatively simple and inexpensive devices made of metal wire or filament designed to melt when the current through it becomes too much.

When the fuse melts, the circuit is interrupted and the current flow is interrupted, preventing damage or destruction of electrical equipment connected to the circuit.

## What is a circuit breaker?

A circuit breaker, on the other hand, is an electrical safety device that works by tripping and interrupting a circuit when the current through it exceeds a certain limit.

Circuit breakers are more sophisticated and reliable than fuses and are designed to automatically detect and interrupt current in the event of an overcurrent or short circuit.

Unlike fuses, circuit breakers can be reset simply by turning them back on, making them a more convenient and cost-effective way to protect electrical circuits.
