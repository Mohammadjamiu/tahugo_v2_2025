The behavior of the `+=` operator is dependent on the **data type** of the initial variable. The `+=` operator can either perform **string concatenation** or **numeric addition**, depending on the initial value.

Here’s how it works:

### 1. **If the Initial Variable is a String:**

- The `+=` operator will perform **string concatenation**.
- Anything added to a string will be converted into a string and appended.

#### Example (String Concatenation):

```javascript
let hexColor = "#"; // String
hexColor += 5; // "5" is concatenated to hexColor, not added as a number
hexColor += 3; // "3" is also concatenated

console.log(hexColor); // Output: "#53"
```

### 2. **If the Initial Variable is a Number:**

- The `+=` operator will perform **numeric addition**.
- Only numbers will be added, and no type conversion happens.

#### Example (Numeric Addition):

```javascript
let totalSum = 0; // Number
totalSum += 5; // Adds 5 to totalSum
totalSum += 3; // Adds 3 to totalSum

console.log(totalSum); // Output: 8
```

### Key Takeaways:

- **If the initial variable is a string**, `+=` will concatenate values as strings. This applies even if you try to add numbers — they will be treated as strings and appended to the end.
- **If the initial variable is a number**, `+=` will perform addition, and the values on the right-hand side must be numbers.
