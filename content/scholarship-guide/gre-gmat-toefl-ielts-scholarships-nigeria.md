![Organizations Offering GRE/GMAT/TOEFL/IELTS Scholarships in Nigeria](/images/scholarship-school-university.webp "Organizations Offering GRE/GMAT/TOEFL/IELTS Scholarships in Nigeria")

Are you a first-class or second-class upper graduate from a low-income background, motivated and highly talented? If so, there are organizations in Nigeria that can sponsor your GRE, GMAT, TOEFL, or IELTS fees, including your application fees. 

These exams are crucial for securing fully funded international scholarships.

> ### :bulb: Understanding the Exams
>
> * **GRE (Graduate Record Examination):** Required for many graduate school programs worldwide.
> * **TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language) and IELTS (International English Language Testing System):** Assess English proficiency for non-native speakers.
> * **GMAT (Graduate Management Admission Test):** Essential for many business school applications.

Given the high costs of these exams and the conversion rate from dollars to naira, it can be challenging for a graduate student to afford them. Fortunately, some organizations are here to help.
