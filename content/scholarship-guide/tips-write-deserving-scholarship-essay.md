I am Adaobi Nnamdi, a biology graduate from Nnamdi Azikiwe University with a first-class degree and a CGPA of 4.85/5.00. My passion lies in biomedical research, particularly in molecular genetics, which I aspire to advance at the postgraduate level.

Beyond academics, I have actively engaged in community health outreach programs, where I applied my knowledge to educate and empower local communities on health issues.
