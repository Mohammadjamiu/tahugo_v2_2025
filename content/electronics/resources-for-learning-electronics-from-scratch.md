Learning electronics can be fun sometimes but for other times can be really frustrating.
So having good resources around can help reduce those frustration and enhance your knowledge on how to build circuits or even how to troubleshoot electronic gadgets.

Because electronics is not something to just study as a theory but needed to be applied practically, and on your way of getting your hands on electronics, you will become better at it.

So in this post, I will be sharing some useful resources to help you learn electronics on your own including YouTube videos, books, websites and even forums (to help you ask questions).

## YouTube channels

<ul class="ul-in-post">

One of the series I love from this channel is that of <a class="links-to-others" target="_blank" href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9EF3C374FD903ACE">according to pete!
</a> because he explains stuffs in a lucid way and especially the videos on transistors. 
<br>
Because for me transistors seems kind of complex before but now has become more clear.
</li>

<li>
<a class="links-to-others" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/MAKE/search?query=collins">Makezine</a>
<br>
Makezine is a youtube channel with lots of electronic resource and part of the series or playlist I love is that of <a class="links-to-others" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv7Y8nAOoFE">Collins Lab</a> in which collins deals with some electronic stuff in a better and fun way.
</li>

<li>
<a class="links-to-others" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/Electroboom/featured">ElectroBOOM </a>

<br>
This channel has some interesting videos that covers some basics of electronics in the aspects of designing and theory for students or even electronics hobbyist. 
<br>
Also there is a forum available by EEVBlog for electrical or electronics lover.
</li>

<li>
<a class="links-to-others" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/MrCarlsonsLab/featured
">MrCarlsonsLab </a>
<br>
MrCarlsonsLab is another YouTube channel that has tons of resource on electronics including the electronics kits you need to have and even how to build a small lab.
</li>

<a class="links-to-others" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/mcwhorpj/featured">Paul McWhorter </a>
<br>
As building circuit with microcontroller is becoming popular and well used, having a knowledge on how to use Arduino or Raspberry Pie is really essential in your journey of becoming an electronics hobbyist.

<br>
Because microcontroller are the key kit or electronic gadgets that IOT (internet of things) revolves around, also it allows you to build circuits fast without having to do everything from scratch.

<br>
Another recommendation is that you can even start to learn electronics by designing circuits with Arduino and this channel really got you covered and that’s what I used to start my journey in learning how microcontrollers work.
<br>
Since working with Arduino, you will have to deal with programming and most especially using C or C++.
<br>
To get a fundamental on that, here is a <a class="links-to-others" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QO_Jlz1qpDw">C programming</a>  tutorial to help you out. Putting in mind that even if you haven’t program before, the Paul McWhorter channel can help you out, so all you need is just build those projects along with his guide.
</li>

<li>
<a class="links-to-others" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/sciguy14/featured">Jeremy Blum  </a>
<br>
Is a geek when it comes to electronics and Arduino, he has a YouTube channel that has some stuffs related to electronics and Arduino and also a book that is a bit more amateurish to help you broaden your knowledge on Arduino.</li>

</ul>
<br>

## Books

Here are few books to help you expand on the knowledge that you couldn’t get from the YouTube channels or what they explained is not clear to you. Also it will be useful for those that loves to read as oppose to watching videos.
