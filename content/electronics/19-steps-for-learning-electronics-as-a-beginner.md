**Learning electronics** is fun because you can think of something and design or make it real. But where the problem lies is not knowing the route to take or what to learn.

So in this posts I will be highlighting how you can learn electronics as a beginner.

## Start with the fundamentals

1. Learn what a circuit is

2. Learn <a href="/electronics/what-is-electricity-and-how-does-it-work/" class="links-to-article"> what an electricity</a> is and also how does it flow

3. Understand the concept of <a href="/circuit-analysis/what-is-voltage-current-and-resistance/" class="links-to-article">voltage, current and resistance </a> and the law that governs them which is <a href="/circuit-analysis/what-is-ohms-law/" class="links-to-article">Ohms law</a>

4. Learn how to analyze and solve simple circuits on paper using some techniques

5. Learn what the most important <a href="/circuit-analysis/electronics-circuit-components-explained/" class="links-to-article">electronics components</a> are and what they are used for

   <a href="/electronics/what-is-a-resistor-used-for/" class="links-to-article">Resistor</a> is used for limiting current as well as to cause voltage drop,

   <a href="/electronics/what-is-a-diode-used-for/" class="links-to-article">Diode</a> is used to allow current flow in one direction,

   Inductors and capacitors are used for storing charges, and

   Transistor is used for switching and amplification purpose,

   LEDs are used for indication and beautification purpose etc.

## Go hands on

6. Get the basic or essential tools needed;

   e.g. jumper wires, battery, breadboard, pairs of cutter, plier, screw-driver, multimeter, glue gum, soldering iron etc.

<!-- here are detailed tools needed as a beginner. -->

7. learn how to read schematic

   One of the annoying thing about electronics, is seeing a huge schematic diagram that can really piss you off but starting with just simple touch design and sketching how things work, then you will be able to read circuit diagrams and that's why it is important to study circuit analysis.

8. Learn how to use breadboard for designing simple circuits

9. Learn how to blink LED using Arduino (microcontroller) and get an <a href="https://amzn.to/3pIgzDO" class="links-to-others" target="_blank">arduino kit</a> for yourself

   It is really important to start learning electronics using microcontrollers because you can get more tasks done faster. You can start learning how to build projects step by step with Arduino using the videos by mcwhorter.

10. Learn how to use transistor which is the most important electronic component you will often work with

11. Learn how to use soldering iron

12. learn how to use multimeter
    because it is a multifunctional tool which let you troubleshoot circuits easily.

13. Learn how to use ICs like 555 timer to build simple but functional and useful circuit

14. Learn how to simulate your circuit using <a href="https://everycircuit.com/" class="links-to-others" target="_blank">Every Circuit</a> or <a href="https://www.pspice.com/" class="links-to-others" target="_blank">Pspice</a>

## General tips

15. learn how to use Google for researching of ICs or part name and even more stuffs you find not clear

16. Start thinking as an engineer and break big projects into components and link them together

17. Start building something for yourself because you might not realize it that the moment you start building something for yourself, you will start learning new stuff because you are constantly researching

18. Join communities because 95 out of 100 times, you would be screwed up when working on electronics but getting other peoples eye and mind on your project, you will get your work done and troubleshooted and that way you will learn what is going wrong.

19. Get any scrap gadget and look through because most time you will find some components you have never seen before or even know what they do. Another thing is that you might get some inspiration on how to better design circuit.

**In conclusion**
<br>

The core of learning electronics and building your own circuit is laying your hand on electronics and build stuffs even if it failed because failure is guaranteed and that's how you learn more.
