**Baseband and broadband transmission** are ways in which digital signals can be transmitted from one point to another.

## Baseband transmission

Baseband transmission refers to transmission in which a digital signal is sent over a channel without changing or converting the digital signal to an analog signal.

## Broadband transmission

Broadband transmission sometimes referred to as modulation means changing or converting a digital signal to analog signal for transmission.

One factor that determines if a signal needs to be transmitted as baseband or broadband is the bandwidth.

In baseband transmission, the required bandwidth is proportional to the bit rate; if we need to send bits faster, we need more bandwidth.

Baseband transmission requires that we have a low-pass channel, a channel with a bandwidth that starts from zero while
Broadband transmission requires that a bandpass channel and only an analog signal can be transmitted.

**In conclusion**, in baseband transmission a digital signal can be directly transmitted through a channel while in broadband transmission the digital signal cannot be transmitted directly so it is first converted to an analog signal before transmission.
