**No, an electronics engineer cannot work as an electrical engineer without additional education and training in the specific areas of electrical engineering.**

Because the two fields have different areas of focus and expertise, despite some overlap.

**Electronics engineering** is a specialized field that deals with the design, development, and testing of electronic circuits, devices, and systems. It focuses on the principles of physics, mathematics, and engineering to design and develop electronic components and systems, such as microprocessors, microcontrollers, sensors, and circuit boards.

On the other hand, **electrical engineering** is a broader field that deals with the study and application of electricity, electromagnetism, and electronics. It involves the use of principles of physics and mathematics to design, develop and test electrical systems and equipment, such as generators, transformers, motors, and communication systems.

As it has been said, there is a certain overlap between electronics engineering and electrical engineering, but the two fields have different areas of expertise. Electrical engineering includes areas such as power systems, control systems, and telecommunications, which are not necessarily part of electronics engineering.

Therefore, an electronics engineer would need additional education and training to gain the necessary expertise to work as an electrical engineer. 

Likewise, an electrical engineer may need additional education and training in order to work as an electronics engineer, depending on the specific area of electronics they wish to pursue.
