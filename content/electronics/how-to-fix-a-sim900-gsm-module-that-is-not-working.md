GSM modules, such as the SIM900, are fantastic tools for communication, but they can be tricky to set up, especially for beginners. 

If you've encountered issues connecting your module, don't worryâ€”I've been there too. 

Let's look into the common problems and solutions for fixing a non-functional SIM900 GSM module. 

For example, maybe the GSM module is not turning ON, or it is turning ON but not connecting.

## **How to Fix a SIM900 GSM Module That's Not Working?**

Here are some common solution to GSM module not working problem,

### 1/ Inadequate Power Supply

GSM modules often come with a power select toggle, allowing you to choose between Arduino or external power. 

However, for optimal performance, it's recommended to use an external power supply with a voltage and current rating of **12V/1A or 5V/2A**.

This simple step can resolve issues related to network connectivity and overall module functionality.

### 2/ Insecure Antenna and U.FL Connector

Ensuring a secure connection for both the antenna and the U.FL connector is crucial. 

A loose U.FL connector, even with power and a SIM card in place, can hinder network connection. 

Take a moment to double-check the tightness of these connections to avoid connectivity issues.

### 3. SIM Card Compatibility

GSM Module supports GPRS (i.e., 2G) but that does not mean you cannot use a 4G SIM card. 

Though, the 4G should support 2G/3G and 4G so in that sense, it will default to 2G when inserted in the GSM module.

### 4. Network Coverage

Sometimes, the issue might not be with the module itself, but with the network coverage in your area. 

If you're facing persistent problems, consider moving to a location with better network reception. 

It's a simple solution that can make a significant difference.

## **How to Know or Check If Your GSM Module is Working?**

To ensure your GSM module is working and connected to the network, keep an eye on the indicator lights.



The power light should be consistently on with a power supply, the status light should be red, and the NetLight or network light should indicate connectivity. 

Calling the SIM card's number should make the lights blink intermittently.

## **Summarized Troubleshooting Steps:**

For a hands-on approach, follow these troubleshooting steps:

1. Check power supply connections.
2. Ensure the antenna and U.FL connector are secure.
3. Confirm SIM card compatibility.
4. Test network coverage in different locations.
5. Verify indicator lights for proper functioning.

## **Wrap Up**

As a wrap up, fixing a non-working SIM900 GSM module may seem daunting, but with these troubleshooting tips shared in this article, you can fix the module in no time.

Remember to check power supplies, secure connections, and network compatibility.
