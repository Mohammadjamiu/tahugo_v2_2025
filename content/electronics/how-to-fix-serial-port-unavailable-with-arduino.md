Have you ever encountered the frustrating issue of “Serial port unavailable” or “No Ports Discovered” when connecting your Arduino board to a computer via USB cable? 

This problem prevents you from uploading your code to the board. In this article, we will be looking at tips on how this issue can be troubleshooted.

## **How to fix “Serial port unavailable” with Arduino**

Here are some troubleshooting tips you can follow to fix it:

### Tip 1: Open Device Manager and Check Port Driver

When faced with Arduino connection problems, the first step is to navigate to the Device Manager on your computer. 

This can be done by searching for “Device Manager” in the Windows search bar. Once there, expand the “Ports (COM & LPT)” section. 

Look for any error messages or warning icons associated with the serial port driver. If issues are found, right-click on the driver and choose “Update driver” or “Uninstall device.”

After uninstallation, click on “Search automatically for updated driver software.”

### Tip 2: Check USB Port Connection

If updating the driver doesn't resolve the issue, inspect the USB cable connecting your Arduino board to the computer. 

A faulty or damaged cable can hinder communication. Try using a different USB port on your computer, as the issue might be port-specific.

### Tip 3: Reinstall Arduino Software

Uninstall the Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE) from your computer. 

Visit the official Arduino website to [download](https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/360019833020-Download-and-install-Arduino-IDE) and install the latest version of the IDE. 

During installation, ensure that the necessary USB drivers are also installed.

> When you get to the stage where the installation prompt will ask “*Would you like to install this device software*”, don't just click enter instantly because that would default to the “don't install” option, but rather click on the “Install” option and then click enter.

### Tip 4: Restart Your Computer

Sometimes, a straightforward solution is a restart. Restart your computer to refresh the system and potentially resolve communication glitches between the Arduino board and your computer.

### Tip 5: Check Board and Port in Arduino IDE

Open the Arduino IDE and navigate to “Tools” > “Port.” 

Ensure the correct port is selected. Also, under “Tools” > “Board,” confirm that the correct Arduino board is chosen.

This step is important for establishing a proper connection.

### Tip 6: Try a Different Arduino Board

If you have access to another Arduino board, try connecting it to your computer. 

This can help determine whether the issue lies with the board itself, or if it's a broader problem.

### Tip 7: Check for Other Software Interference

Certain software, especially antivirus or security programs, may interfere with the USB connection. 

Temporarily disable these programs and check if the Arduino connectivity issue persists.

### Tip 8: Community Support

If none of the above solutions work, don't hesitate to seek help on the [Arduino forum](https://forum.arduino.cc/). 

The community is a valuable resource, and fellow enthusiasts may have encountered similar issues and can provide additional guidance.

## **Wrap Up**

As a wrap up, following these troubleshooting tips, you can identify and address common Arduino connection issues. 

Remember to check the serial port driver, USB cable, reinstall the Arduino software, restart your computer, verify settings in the Arduino IDE, try an alternative board, and consider software interference. 

If all else fails, the supportive Arduino community is there to assist.
