## **What is Transmission Media?**

Transmission media in computer networks refer to the physical means through which signals are transmitted from one device to another. 

It serves as a conduit for the transfer of data, allowing communication between devices within a network. 

Transmission media can be categorized into two main types: 

* Guided (Wired), and 
* Unguided (Wireless)

## **Guided Media (Wired)**

Guided media also known as wired media use physical cables to transmit signals. The three commonly used types of guided media in computer networks are coaxial cable, twisted-pair cable, and fiber optic cable.

### **1. Coaxial Cable**

Coaxial cable consists of a central conductor surrounded by an insulating layer, which is further encased in a braided or foil shield.
