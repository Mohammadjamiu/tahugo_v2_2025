Although they differ in the way they handle data transmission, there are some similarities between these two switching techniques.

## Similarities Between Circuit Switching and Packet Switching

Here are some similarities between circuit switching and packet switching:

1. Circuit switching and packet switching are used for data transmission across a network.
2. Both techniques require a communication channel to be established between the sender and the receiver for transmission of data to take place.
3. Circuit switching and packet switching both can be used for transmitting information such as voice, data, and video.
4. Both techniques have to deal with issues of traffic congestion and delay in the network.
5. Both techniques require the use of network protocols to ensure reliable data transmission.
6. Circuit switching and packet switching can be used in both wired and wireless networks.
