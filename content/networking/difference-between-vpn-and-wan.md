**VPN (Virtual Private Network)** and **WAN (Wide Area Network)** are two different technologies used for different purposes in computer networking.

## What is VPN?

**VPN, or Virtual Private Network**, is a technology that allows users to create a secure and private connection over the internet.

It creates a virtual private network between two or more devices or networks, encrypting and securing all data that is transmitted between them.

VPNs are commonly used by businesses and individuals to protect their online privacy, bypass internet censorship, and access resources that are not available on the public internet.

## What is WAN?

**WAN, or Wide Area Network**, is a network that connects devices over a large geographical area just like LAN â€“ which is used to connect devices in a local area such as homes and small offices.

It enables devices to communicate with each other over long distances, allowing businesses to connect their remote offices and employees to work together as if they were in the same location.

WANs can be created using various technologies, such as leased lines, satellite links, and microwave links.

## Difference Between VPN and WAN

The main differences between VPN and WAN are:

|     | Factors              | VPN                                                                                                                                                                                                                | WAN                                                                                                                                      |

| 1.  | **Name**             | VPN stands for **Virtual Private Network.**                                                                                                                                                                        | WAN is a short form for **Wide Area Network.**                                                                                           |
| 2.  | **Purpose or Usage** | VPNs are used to create a private and secure connection between two or more devices over the internet.                                                                                                             | WANs are used to connect devices over a large geographical area.                                                                         |
| 3.  | **Security**         | VPNs are designed with security in mind, and they use encryption and other security measures to ensure that data transmitted over the network is protected from unauthorized access.                               | WANs may not offer the same level of security as VPNs, as they can be vulnerable to attacks such as eavesdropping and data interception. |
| 4.  | **Connectivity**     | VPNs connect devices through the internet.                                                                                                                                                                         | WANs connect devices through a variety of means, such as satellite links, and microwave links.                                           |
| 5.  | **Cost**             | VPNs can be less expensive than WANs, as they do not require the same level of hardware and infrastructure as WANs. However, the cost of VPNs can vary depending on the level of security and the number of users. | WANs are typically more expensive than VPN as it requires more hardware and infrastructures.                                             |
| 6.  | **Implementation**   | VPNs can be implemented quickly and easily.                                                                                                                                                                        | WANs can require more time, effort, and resources to set up and maintain.                                                                |
