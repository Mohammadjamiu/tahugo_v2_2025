## **What is a Computer Network?**

A computer network refers to a collection of interconnected devices, such as computers, servers, routers, and switches, that communicate and share resources with each other. 

These devices are linked together through various communication channels, such as wired or wireless connections, to facilitate the transfer of data and information.

## **Types of Computer Networks**

Computer networks come in various types, each serving different purposes and covering different areas. Let's explore the different types of computer networks:

There are several types of computer networks:

* Local Area Network (LAN)
* Wide Area Network (WAN)
* Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)
* Personal Area Network (PAN)
* Campus Area Network (CAN)
* Storage Area Network (SAN)
* Virtual Private Network (VPN)
* Intranet
* Extranet

Now, let's dive into each type of network in detail.

## **Final Thoughts**

In conclusion, understanding the various types of computer networks is essential for building efficient communication systems and optimizing resource sharing. 

Each network type, such as LANs, WANs, MANs, PANs, CANs, SANs, VPNs, Intranets, Extranets, and CDNs, has its own set of characteristics, advantages, disadvantages, and practical applications.

While each network type offers unique benefits, there are also considerations to keep in mind. These include potential limitations such as coverage constraints, maintenance requirements, costs, and security implications. 

Organizations need to assess their specific needs and goals when choosing and implementing the appropriate network type.
