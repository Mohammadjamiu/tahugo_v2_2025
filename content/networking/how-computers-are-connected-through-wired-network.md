<p>
In most small offices or homes, to access the internet, it can be
done through turning on our mobile hostpot so other devices can
connect to it and use the internet. 
</p>
<p>But connecting more devices
makes our signal weak, also moving the mobile phone away from other
devices that are connected to it, makes the signal to go down. Thats
why wired network are used at big companies, small offices and
sometimes at home if one is able to afford for a mini setup.</p>

<p>
Another advantage of using wired network is because it allows what
is called <span class="text-italics">shared network</span> i.e when you connect your
device to a central point, someone using a computer can send stuff
to another, or to a printer and so on.
</p>
<img loading="lazy" src="/images/framework1_7.webp" alt="">
<p>The framework is as simple as the sketch below.</p>
<img loading="lazy" src="/images/framework1_10.webp" alt="">
<p>
At first, we got <span class="text-emphasis">a cloud</span> which can be thought of as our internet
which we are provided access to through our ISP (Internet Service
Provider) which can be MTN, Airtel in Most African countries like
Nigeria and the rest or AT&T, Vodafone in other countries like the
U.S, UK. 
</p>
<p>Connected to the the cloud (or internet) is <span class="text-emphasis">a modem</span>, and it is a
word that we're most familiar with or we've heard of sometimes. </p>
<p>What
this modem does is, it takes signal either from the internet or from
our devices and make necessary conversion called modulation and
demodulation respectively, and thats where the word
<span>MO</span> and <span>DEM</span> comes from.</p>
<img loading="lazy" src="/images/framework1_9.webp" alt="">
<p>
The next device is a <span class="text-emphasis">router</span>, and it is also a term that we are
familiar with. What it does is, if you can remember, we say we can
share files through wired network right, but most modem has only one
output port at it back which means we can only connect it to a
single device like our laptop. 
</p>
<p>But our mission is to share files not
only between our device and the internet but also within the devices
themselves. That's where router comes in because, it pave way (or
route) for different devices to have access to the internet through
modem and also share files between themselves.</p>
<p>
And the last stage is <span class="text-emphasis">the devices</span> we can connect, to have shared
network e.g computers, printers, TVs, etc.
</p>

<p>
To note also, a modem, if it is the only main device connected to
the internet in our framework without a router, or with the router
which our devices are connected to, also allows our mobile phone to
be connected to it through Wi-fi which means it is integrated into
this devices.
</p>

<p>
The wire used to make this connections are called the <span class="text-emphasis">Ethernet
cables</span>, also called cat 5 or cat 6 (i.e category 5 or 6).
</p>
<img loading="lazy" src="/images/framework1_6.webp" alt="">
<p>
Lastly, this network connection is called LAN (Local Area Network) because
it is a connection made for small offices or homes or even a big
company.

Hope you get the fundamentals, but if there's something more you can
enlight us on, contact us we do appreciate.
