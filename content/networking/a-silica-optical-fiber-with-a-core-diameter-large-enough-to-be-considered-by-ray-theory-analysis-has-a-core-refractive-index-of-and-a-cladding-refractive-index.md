## Question:

### A silica optical fiber with a core diameter large enough to be considered by ray theory analysis has a core refractive index of 1.50 and a cladding refractive index of 1.47.

### Determine: (a) the critical angle at the core–cladding interface; (b) the NA for the fiber; (c) the acceptance angle in air for the fiber.

## Solution/Given:

**Here are the given from the question.**

Core refractive index (n<sub>1</sub>) = 1.50

Cladding refractive index (n<sub>2</sub>) = 1.47

Critical angle at the core–cladding interface φ<sub>c</sub> = ?

Numerical aperture (NA for the fiber) = ?

Acceptance angle in air for the fiber (θ<sub>a</sub>) = ?

**(a) To find the critical angle φ<sub>c</sub> from the core and cladding refractive index,**

φ<sub>c</sub>  = sin<sup>−1</sup>(n<sub>2</sub>/n<sub>1</sub>) = sin<sup>−1</sup>(1.47/1.5) = 78.5°

**(b) The NA can be found by using the equation,** NA = (n<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> - n<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup>)<sup>0.5</sup>

\= (<sub>1.5</sub><sup>2</sup> - <sub>1.47</sub><sup>2</sup>)<sup>0.5</sup>

\= (2.25 − 2.16)<sup>0.5</sup> = 0.3

**(c) The acceptance angle in air θ<sub>a</sub>**

\= θ<sub>a</sub>  = sin<sup>−1</sup>(NA) = sin<sup>−1</sup>(0.30)

\= 17.4°
