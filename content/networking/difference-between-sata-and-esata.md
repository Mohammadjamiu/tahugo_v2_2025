Both **SATA and eSATA** are connectors which are used for connecting storage devices. SATA is used to connect internal storage devices, while eSATA is used to connect external devices.

## Difference between SATA and eSATA

|     | SATA                                                                                                                                                                                          | eSATA

| 1   | **SATA** stand for Serial Advanced Technology Attachment                                                                                                                                      | **eSATA** stands for external Serial Advanced Technology Attachment                                              
| 2   | **SATA** is a connector which is used to connect internal storage devices                                                                                                                     | **eSATA** is a connector which is used to connect external storage devices                                       
| 3   | **SATA** has a cable length of 1 m or 3.3ft                                                                                                                                                   | **eSATA** has a cable length of 2 m or 6.6ft                                                                     
| 4   | **SATA** is commonly used for data storage                                                                                                                                                    | **eSATA** is commonly used for audio processing and video processing                                             
| 5   | **SATA** has several versions such as SATA I, SATA II, SATA III and SATAe (SATA express) and they support speed in the range of 1.5 Gbits/s, 3 Gbits/s, 6 Gbits/s and 16 Gbits/s respectively | **eSATA** does not have several versions                                                                         
| 6   | **SATA** cables is less thick than eSATA's cable                                                                                                                                              | **eSATA** cables is thicker than SATA's cable to prevent interference as the length is increased from 1 m to 2 m
