**ChatGPT** has set the tech industry ablaze with its unprecedented language processing capabilities. 

It was released to the public in the late November 2022 and in just few months, ChatGPT is able to reach over 100 millions users.

News of its impact at Google has sparked a “code red” situation, prompting the CEO of Google Sundar Pichai to call on the company's founders to re-engage in discussions about AI's future as the tech giant. 

As a result of the discussion, Google is now gearing up to unveil over 20 cutting-edge AI-based products and a search engine with chatbot features in 2023.

To combat ChatGPT's impact, Google released it own version which was available for only those that join their waitlist called **Google Bard**.

**You can join the waitlist [here](https://bard.google.com/).**

The question now is that as Google Bard is a rival to ChatGPT, is it better than ChatGPT?

Yes, **Google Bard is better than ChatGPT in terms of its ability to give information about latest events, give a concise response to queries or prompt and also enhance user readability by highlighting key points.**

But one of the shortcoming of Bard is that it is not robust as ChatGPT because it is release out of anxiety or fear of ChatGPT reducing its power as a tech giant or dominating the Internet.

## **What Are the Similarities Between Google Bard and ChatGPT?**

**Google Bard** and **ChatGPT** are both large language models (LLMs) that have been trained on vast datasets of text and code. 

They share the ability to generate text, translate languages, write creative content, and provide informative answers.

Google Bard and ChatGPT are still in development but have learned to perform various tasks, such as following instructions, answering questions comprehensively, and generating diverse forms of text content, like poems, code, scripts, and musical pieces. 

They aim to fulfill users' requirements thoughtfully, even if they are challenging or unusual.

## **What Are the Differences Between Google Bard and ChatGPT?**

**Google Bard and ChatGPT** differ in a few ways. Bard is trained on a continuously updated dataset chosen to improve its conversation skills, with real-time access to the internet, while ChatGPT uses a dataset dated up to 2021.

Bard is built on **LaMDA**, whereas ChatGPT is built on GPT-3.5. Finally, Bard is currently in beta, while ChatGPT is more widely accessible.

> **LaMDA** is a large language model (LLM) chatbot developed by Google AI. It is trained on a massive dataset of text and code, and can generate text, translate languages, write different kinds of creative content, and answer your questions in an informative way.

## **Which Is Better, Google Bard or ChatGPT?**

To see which one is better, we need to test both with the same prompts and compare the output response given by each.

**Prompt #1:** Who currently own twitter?

> **According to ChatGPT, here is the response:**
>
> As of my knowledge cutoff date of September 2021, Twitter is a publicly traded company listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the ticker symbol "TWTR". Therefore, it is owned by its shareholders, who can buy and sell shares on the stock market. The largest shareholders at that time were investment firms and funds, including The Vanguard Group, BlackRock, and Morgan Stanley. Jack Dorsey was the CEO of Twitter at the time, but he has since stepped down and been replaced by Parag Agrawal.

<br/>

> **While according to Google Bard, here is its response:**
>
> As of March 8, 2023, Twitter is owned by Elon Musk. Musk acquired Twitter in October 2022 for $44 billion.

Here comes one of the good side of Google Bard, which is the ability to give response to queries that has to do with current events or information.

Whereas, ChatGPT only has information about who owns twitter as of 2021 backward.

Another point is that, Bard tries as much to provide a very concise response which is quite informative. 

Though ChatGPT is able to give an informative response which is dated to 2021, but the way Bard structure its response is far better.

**Prompt #2 :** Give me tips on how to write a book?

> **Here is the response given by ChatGPT:**
>
> 1. Define your purpose and audience: Before you start writing, identify the reason you want to write the book and who you're writing it for. This will help you stay focused on your goals and create a targeted message.
> 2. Create an outline: A book outline helps you organize your thoughts and ensures that your book flows logically. Decide on your chapter headings, subheadings, and key points for each section.
> 3. Set a writing schedule: Determine a writing schedule that works for you and stick to it. Whether you choose to write for a set amount of time each day or a certain number of words per day, establish a consistent routine to keep yourself motivated and on track.
> 4. Just start writing: Don't worry about making your writing perfect in the first draft. Focus on getting your ideas down on paper and editing later.
> 5. Edit and revise: Once you've completed a draft of your book, take a break before starting the editing process. Then, go back and revise your work with fresh eyes. Consider working with a professional editor to provide feedback and catch any errors.
> 6. Get feedback: Share your work with trusted friends, family members, or colleagues and ask for their feedback. Consider joining a writing group to connect with other authors and get constructive criticism.
> 7. Stay motivated: Writing a book is a long-term project, and it's easy to get discouraged along the way. Set realistic goals for yourself and celebrate each milestone you achieve. Remember why you started writing in the first place and stay focused on your purpose.
> 8. Keep learning: Continuously seek to improve your writing skills by reading books on writing craft, attending writing workshops, and practicing regularly. The more you write, the better you'll become.

<br/>

> **Here is the response from Google Bard:**
>
> 1. **Choose a topic that you are passionate about.** This will make the writing process more enjoyable and easier to stick with.
> 2. **Do your research.** Make sure you know what you are talking about before you start writing.
> 3. **Create an outline.** This will help you stay on track and make sure that your book has a clear beginning, middle, and end.
> 4. **Start writing!** Don't worry about making it perfect at first, just get your ideas down on paper.
> 5. **Edit and revise.** Once you have a draft, take some time to edit and revise it. This is where you will polish your writing and make sure that it is as good as it can be.
> 6. **Get feedback.** Ask friends, family, or beta readers to read your book and give you feedback. This will help you identify any areas that need improvement.
> 7. **Don't give up!** Writing a book is a lot of work, but it is also very rewarding. If you stick with it, you will eventually have a finished product that you can be proud of.
>
> Here are some additional tips:
>
> * **Find a quiet place to write where you won't be interrupted.**
> * **Set aside some time each day to write, even if it's just for 30 minutes.**
> * **Reward yourself for reaching milestones, such as finishing a chapter or a scene.**
> * **Don't be afraid to experiment with your writing style.**
> * **Have fun!** Writing should be enjoyable, so don't take it too seriously.

As you can see, both ChatGPT and Google Bard did a great job by sharing informative tips on how to write a book. If you find it informative too, wait no more and start writing your book.

One thing that differ in the results is that Google Bard highlights the key points which help to enhance user's readability, unlike ChatGPT, which gives out the text without any highlighting.

**Prompt #3 :** Write a JavaScript code that add 4 numbers together?

> **Here is ChatGPT's response to the prompt:**
>
> Here's a JavaScript code that adds 4 numbers together:
>
> ```javascript
> let num1 = 5;
> let num2 = 10;
> let num3 = 15;
> let num4 = 20;
>
> let sum = num1 + num2 + num3 + num4;
>
> console.log(sum); // Output: 50
> ```
>
> In this example, we declared four variables `num1`, `num2`, `num3`, and `num4`, each containing a numeric value. We then added the four numbers together and assigned the result to a new variable called `sum`. Finally, we used `console.log()` to display the result in the console.

<br/>

> **Here is Google Bard's response to the prompt:**
>
> Sure, here is a JavaScript code that adds four numbers together:
>
> ```javascript
> function addFourNumbers(num1, num2, num3, num4) {
>   return num1 + num2 + num3 + num4;
> }
> ```
>
> This function takes four numbers as input and returns their sum. For example, if we call the function with the arguments 1, 2, 3, and 4, it will return 10.
>
> Here is an example of how to use the function:
>
> ```javascript
> var sum = addFourNumbers(1, 2, 3, 4);
> console.log(sum); // 10
> ```

From the results gotten above, it can be noted that they both did a great job.

But one thing is that when it comes to code's prompt, ChatGPT tries as much to give a beginner-friendly example and explanation.

Unlike, Google Bard that gives a better result, but it's quite not as clarifying for beginners as ChatGPT did.

### Key Takeaway:

**Google Bard is superior to ChatGPT** in terms of its ability to provide information on recent events and its access to the internet. It is trained on real-time internet information, which enables it to stay up to date with the latest developments. 

Additionally, Google Bard can leverage Google Search to access real-world data, further expanding its capabilities.

Google Bard also stands out by delivering concise responses to queries or prompts. It has the ability to enhance user readability by highlighting key information, making it easier for users to extract relevant details from the generated text.

Nevertheless, since Google Bard is still under development, it may have a higher potential for errors compared to ChatGPT. As with any evolving technology, there may be room for improvement and refinement.

ChatGPT, on the other hand, offers a unique and interesting user experience. It generates responses character-by-character or word-by-word, making the process of prompting and receiving answers more engaging.

This incremental response generation adds an element of anticipation and curiosity to the interaction.

ChatGPT is a more mature product compared to Google Bard. It has been trained on data until late 2021, which means it may not have the same level of knowledge about recent events and developments as Google Bard. 

However, this maturity also contributes to its reliability, as it has undergone extensive training and refinement.

**In terms of user experience,** ChatGPT offers a convenient feature that allows users to access their previously searched queries and their corresponding responses on the left sidebar. This helps users retrieve information easily and contributes to a better overall user experience.

In contrast, with Google Bard, it can be challenging to access previously searched questions and answers. Users can only see the prompt they asked from the Bard Activity bar, and if they want the response, they have to ask the question again.

When deciding which model to choose, it is essential to consider your specific needs and preferences. 

If you require access to real-time information and advanced capabilities, Google Bard may be the better option. However, if reliability and a more engaging user experience are important to you, ChatGPT could be a more suitable choice.
