I moved my Hugo website to Next.js, but all the emojis I used with markdown syntax (e.g., `:warning:` or `:bulb:`) were displayed as text instead of actual emoji icons. I needed Next.js to recognize the emoji text like `:bulb:` in the MDX content and render it as an emoji icon.

### How I Fixed the Issue

1. **Installed the Required Plugin**  
   I searched online and found that I needed the `remark-emoji` plugin to handle emoji rendering in MDX files. I installed it by running:

   ```bash
   pnpm add remark-emoji
   ```

2. **Updated Next.js Config**  
   In my `velite.config.ts` (since Iâ€™m using [Velite](https://velite.js.org/) for MDX content), I added the `remark-emoji` plugin to the `remarkPlugins` array, which is used to configure MDX processing:

   ```javascript
   mdx: {
     rehypePlugins: [
       rehypeSlug,
       [rehypePrettyCode, { theme: "github-dark" }],
       [
         rehypeAutoLinkHeadings,
         {
           behavior: "wrap",
           properties: {
             className: ["subheading-anchor"],
             ariaLabel: "Link to section",
           },
         },
       ],
     ],
     remarkPlugins: [remarkEmoji],
   },
   ```

3. **Tested the Emoji Rendering**  
   After making the changes, I restarted the development server, and the emojis in my MDX files were rendered correctly as icons instead of text.
