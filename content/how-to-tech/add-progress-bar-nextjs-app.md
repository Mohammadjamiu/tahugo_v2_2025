I noticed that my Next.js blog post page took some time to load, which made the website feel unresponsive.

Even though Iâ€™ve been optimizing the app by dynamically importing modules, tracking large package sizes, and making improvements, it still felt sluggish to users.

To address this, I decided to add a progress bar at the top of the page.

Interestingly, it gives a sense of activity, reducing the perception of unresponsiveness.

Itâ€™s funny how our brains workâ€”just seeing a loading bar feels reassuring!

**I Followed These Steps...**  
To implement a progress bar in my Next.js 15 app, I used the _**Next NProgress Bar**_ package. Hereâ€™s how I did it:

1. **Install the Package**

   I installed the package using:

   ```bash
   pnpm i next-nprogress-bar
   ```

   If youâ€™re using npm, you can run:

   ```bash
   npm i next-nprogress-bar
   ```

2. **Create a ProgressBarProvider Component**

   I followed the package documentation and created a provider component to wrap my application.

   This ensures that the progress bar is properly integrated without requiring the `use client` directive in my layout.

   Here's a link to the package documentation on npmjs. [https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-nprogress-bar](https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-nprogress-bar)

   ```js
   // /components/ProgressBarProvider.tsx
   "use client";

   import { AppProgressBar as ProgressBar } from "next-nprogress-bar";

   const Providers = ({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) => {
     return (
       <>
         {children}
         <ProgressBar
           height="4px"
           color="#fffd00"
           // This line above ðŸ‘†
           options={{ showSpinner: false }}
           shallowRouting
         />
       </>
     );
   };

   export default Providers;
   ```

   Note: You can customize the progress bar color using HEX or HSL values.

3. **Import and use the Provider inside `layout.tsx`**  
   I imported the `Providers` component into the `layout.tsx` file to wrap the `{children}`.

   ```js
   // /app/layout.tsx
   import Providers from "@/components/ProgressBarProvider";
   // This line above ðŸ‘†
   export const metadata = {
     title: "My Next.js App",
     description: "Optimized with a progress bar",
   };

   export default function RootLayout({
     children,
   }: {
     children: React.ReactNode,
   }) {
     return (
       <html lang="en">
         <body>
           <Providers>{children}</Providers>
           // This line above ðŸ‘†
         </body>
       </html>
     );
   }
   ```

Wrapping the app this way avoids making the `layout.tsx` a client component, which is not ideal for performance.

After completing the setup, I ran my app locally to test the changes.

The progress bar now gives immediate feedback to users, significantly improving the perceived speed of my app.

While thereâ€™s still an initial cold start, the progress bar improves the user experience, making the site feel faster.

Hopefully, future updates in Next.js will address this issue. Thanks to the Next.js team for their contributions to the dev community!
