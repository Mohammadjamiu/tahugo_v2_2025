Are you tired of the default VS Code terminal that's tucked away at the bottom of your screen? Do you want to open it in a new window, giving you more workspace and flexibility for your coding projects?

In this guide, we'll look at the steps you can follow to open the VS Code terminal in a separate window, making your coding experience more efficient and enjoyable.

## **Steps on How to Open VSCode Terminal in a Separate Window**

### Step 1: Open the File

First, open the file you want to work on. In our example, we're working on a C program.

![terminal attached to windows](/images/terminal-attached.webp "terminal attached to windows")

Instead of launching the terminal through the View menu and having it appear at the bottom of the screen, we will be opening it in a new window.

### Step 2: Create a New Window

Right-click on the “File” menu or use the keyboard shortcut “Ctrl+Shift+N” to create a new separate window.

![create new window](/images/create-new-windows.webp "create new window")

![old and new window](/images/old-window-and-new-window.webp "old and new window")

This new window will be where your terminal will reside, giving you more flexibility.

### Step 3: Launch the Terminal

Once the new window appears, navigate to the “View” menu and choose the “Terminal” option, or use the shortcut “Ctrl+`” (backtick).

![launch terminal](/images/terminal-in-the-new-window.webp "launch terminal")

This will open the terminal as usual, but now it's in your new window.

### Step 4: Navigate to Your Workspace

To make sure the terminal has access to the folder or file you are working on in the old window, you'll need to navigate to the appropriate path.

If you're using Windows, you can use the `cd <folder_name>` command to enter any folder you need or the file you are working on.

That's all it :tada: keep coding!
