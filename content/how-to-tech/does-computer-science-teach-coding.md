**Yes, computer science often includes teaching coding as a core part of the discipline.** 

**Coding** involves writing instructions in a programming language to control the operation of a computer, and is an important tool for solving computer problems and creating software, applications, and systems. 

However, the focus of computer science education can vary, with some programs emphasizing on software and others emphasizing on theoretical computer science, algorithms, data structures, and other areas. 

In general, computer science education provides a foundation in computer systems and software, as well as a deep understanding of algorithms, data structures, and computer theory. 

Students that wish to study computer science will learn to code and develop various programming languages ​​to develop software, websites, mobile applications and other computer systems. 

As a beginner in computer science, you will start with the basics of programming, such as syntax, data types, and control structures, and then move on to more advanced topics, such as databases, computer networks, and artificial intelligence.
