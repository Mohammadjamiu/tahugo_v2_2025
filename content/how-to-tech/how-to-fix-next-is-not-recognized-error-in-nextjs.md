If you're working with Next.js and encounter the error message “`'next' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file,`” don't worry; you're not alone. 

This common issue can be frustrating, and in this article, we will look at how to fix the error.

## **Why Does the Error Occur?**

The error occurs because the Next.js command is not in your system's PATH environment variable,

and this can happen due to uninstalled dependencies, global installation issues, or local installation problems.

## **Steps on How to Fix 'next' is not Recognized Error in Next.js**

To resolve the “'next' is not recognized” error, follow these steps:

### 1. Install Next.js Dependencies

Start by ensuring that you have all the necessary dependencies installed. 

Open your terminal and run the following command:

```shell
npm install next // If you are using Node Package Manager (NPM)

or

yarn add next // If you are using Yarn

```

This command will install the required Next.js dependencies for your project.

### 2. Install Next.js Globally

If you haven't installed Next.js globally, you can do so with the following command:

```shell
npm install next -g

or

yarn global add next

```

This will install Next.js as a global package on your system.

### 3. Update PATH Environment Variable

Add the Next.js directory to your system's PATH environment variable. 

Replace `your_username` with your actual username and `v18.0.0` with the version of Node.js you're using. 

Run the following command:

```shell
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.nvm/versions/node/v18.0.0/bin
```

This command ensures that your system recognizes Next.js as a valid command.

### 4. Restart Your Terminal

To apply the changes, close and reopen your terminal.

Once you've completed these steps, you should be able to run the Next.js command from any directory in your system without encountering the error.

## Additional Troubleshooting

If you're still experiencing issues, consider these troubleshooting tips:

* Make sure you're running the command from the root directory of your Next.js project.
* Try running the command with the full path to the Next.js executable file, especially if you've installed Next.js locally. For example:

  ```shell
  /Users/your_username/Desktop/my-next-project/node_modules/next/bin/next dev
  ```
