When it comes to debugging and logging messages in JavaScript, two commonly used methods are `console.log` and `console.info`. 

Although they may seem similar, they have distinct characteristics that make them useful in different scenarios. 

In this article, we will look at the differences between `console.log` and `console.info` and learn when to use each method effectively.

{{< table-of-contents >}}

## Overview of `console.log`

The `console.log` method is widely used for logging messages in JavaScript. It allows developers to output informative messages, variables, or objects to the console. 

Here's an example:

```javascript
const name = "John";
const age = 30;

console.log("Name:", name);
console.log("Age:", age);
```

In this example, we log the values of the `name` and `age` variables using `console.log`. The output will be:

```


Name: John
Age: 30
```

## Understanding `console.info`

On the other hand, the `console.info` method is specifically designed for logging informational messages. 

It is similar to `console.log` in terms of usage, but it is intended to convey information that may be more helpful than regular logging. 

Let's see an example:

```javascript
const importantMessage = "Remember to save your progress!";
console.info(importantMessage);
```

![console.info](/images/console.info.webp "console.info")

In this example, we use `console.info` to log an important message. The output will be styled differently, depending on the browser's implementation, to indicate that it is an informational message.

## Differences between `console.log` and `console.info`

### Output appearance

One of the main differences between `console.log` and `console.info` is their output appearance. 

While the exact styling may vary across browsers, `console.info` messages are typically displayed in a distinctive way, such as with an “i” icon or a different text color. 

This visual distinction helps differentiate informational messages from regular log messages.

### Default behavior

Another important distinction is the default behavior of these methods. In most browsers, the `console.log` method outputs messages with the default logging level, often set to “log.” 

On the other hand, `console.info` messages are displayed with a different default logging level, such as "info.” 

This difference can be useful when categorizing and filtering log messages based on their importance or type.

### Message importance

While both methods serve the purpose of logging messages, `console.log` is generally used for general-purpose logging, including informational messages, warnings, or errors. 

`console.info` on the other hand, is specifically intended for providing important informational content. 

It implies that the logged message contains crucial details that are useful for understanding the execution flow or the state of the application.

### Log levels

In some browser environments, log messages are categorized into different levels, such as “log," "info," "warn," or "error." 

These levels enable developers to filter and control the visibility of messages in the console. By default, `console.log` messages are often assigned the "log" level, while \`console.info\` messages are assigned the "info" level. 

However, it's important to note that log levels and their behaviors can vary across different browsers.

## Use cases for `console.log`

The versatility of `console.log` makes it suitable for various use cases, including:

* Logging general messages or variables during development
* Debugging code by printing values or object properties

Here's an example of using `console.log` for debugging:

```javascript
function addNumbers(a, b) {
  console.log("Adding numbers:", a, "+", b);
  return a + b;
}

const result = addNumbers(5, 10);
console.log("Result:", result);
```

The output will be:

```


Adding numbers: 5 + 10
Result: 15
```

## Use cases for `console.info`

The distinctive styling and default log level of `console.info` make it ideal for specific use cases, such as:

* Providing important information about the application's state
* Displaying key details during program execution

Here's an example of using `console.info` to convey important information:

```javascript
const username = "john123";
console.info(`Welcome, ${username}! Your session expires in 10 minutes.`);
```

The output will be visually distinct, indicating that it is an informational message.

## Best practices for using `console.log` and `console.info`

To make the most out of `console.log` and `console.info`, consider the following best practices:

1. Use `console.log` for general-purpose logging and debugging.
2. Utilize `console.info` to convey important details or instructions.
3. Be mindful of the log levels and their behavior in different browser environments.
4. Use both methods judiciously to maintain clarity and avoid information overload.
5. Remember to remove or comment out any logging statements in production code to prevent unnecessary console output.

## Wrap Up

`console.log` and `console.info` are both valuable tools for logging messages in JavaScript. 

While they share similarities, their subtle differences make them suitable for specific use cases. 

Having a good understanding of these differences and using them effectively, developers can enhance their debugging and logging capabilities.

## FAQs

1. **Can I use `console.log` and `console.info` together in the same codebase?** Yes! These methods are not mutually exclusive. You can use them together based on the specific requirements of your application.
2. **Are there any performance differences between `console.log` and `console.info`?** Generally, the performance impact of using either method is minimal. \
   \
   The actual impact may vary based on the browser implementation and the number of log messages being processed.
3. **Can I style the output of `console.log` or `console.info` messages?** The styling of log messages is browser-dependent, and direct customization options are limited. \
   However, you can use CSS formatting techniques to add custom styles to the output in some browsers.
4. **Are `console.log` and `console.info` available in all JavaScript environments?** While these methods are widely supported in modern browsers and JavaScript environments, it's always recommended to check the compatibility with the target platforms or versions you are developing for.
5. **Is it a good practice to leave `console.log` or `console.info` statements in production code?** No, it's generally advised to remove or comment out logging statements from production code. \
   \
   This helps maintain a clean codebase and prevents unnecessary console output in the production environment.
