WhatsApp is one of the most popular messaging apps in the world, connecting people across the globe. 

However, being part of multiple group chats can sometimes lead to a flood of notifications, making it challenging to maintain your peace and focus. 

Fortunately, WhatsApp offers a solution by allowing you to mute group notifications or unmute them when you're ready to rejoin the conversation.

## **Steps on How to Mute Group Notifications**

### **Step 1: Open the Group Chat**

The first step in muting group notifications on WhatsApp is to open the group chat that you want to silence. 

This can be a family group, a work-related chat, or any other group you're part of.

Select the duration that suits your needs by tapping on it.

For example, if you mute the notification for a week, it will show the date when the muting will elapse.

## **Steps on How to Unmute Group Notifications**

Sometimes, you may want to rejoin the conversation in a group chat that you previously muted. 

Here's how you can unmute group notifications on WhatsApp:

### **Step 1: Open the Group Chat Again**

To unmute notifications, open the group chat you muted earlier. 

You can do this by scrolling through your chat list and selecting the group.

### **Step 2: Tap the Group Name**

Once inside the group chat, tap the name of the group chat at the top of the screen to access group settings.

### **Step 3: Unmute Notifications**

In the group settings, scroll to the “**mute notification**” and toggle back the notification to unmute.

This will enable notifications for the group once again.

## **Things to Keep in Mind**

While muting group notifications can provide relief from constant alerts, there are some important points to remember:

* You will still receive messages from the group, but you will not be notified about them.
* You can still see the number of unread messages in the group chat.
* You can still open the group chat to see the messages.
* Muting group notifications does not affect your ability to send or receive **messages in the group.**

## **FAQs**

1. **Can I mute notifications for multiple group chats at once?** No, you need to mute notifications for each group chat individually.
2. **Will muting group notifications remove me from the group?** No, muting notifications only silences alerts; you remain a member of the group.
3. **Can I customize the duration for muting notifications?** WhatsApp provides preset durations: 1 hour, 8 hours, 24 hours, or 7 days. You can choose from these options.
4. **What if I change my mind and want to unmute notifications before the selected duration ends?** You can manually unmute notifications at any time by following the steps mentioned in the guide.
5. **Does muting notifications affect the group's ability to see my messages?** No, muting notifications only affects your alerts; other group members can still see your messages.
6. **Is there a limit to how long I can mute group notifications?** WhatsApp's longest mute duration is 7 days. If you wish to continue muting notifications, you'll need to renew the mute setting after 7 days.
