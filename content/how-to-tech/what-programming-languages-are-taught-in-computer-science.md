**The specific programming languages taught can vary depending on the institution, the course level (e.g., introductory, intermediate, advanced), and the focus of the course (e.g., web development, data science, game development, etc.).**

In addition to learning specific programming languages, computer science courses typically teach fundamental concepts of computer science such as algorithms, data structures, and software development methodologies. 

These concepts can be applied to many programming languages, making them valuable skills for a computer science graduate, regardless of the specific language(s) they learned in their studies.

## What is Computer Science?

**Computer science** is a field of study that deals with the design, development, and use of computer systems and technology. It includes the study of algorithms, programming languages, software engineering, computer hardware and architecture, databases, and human-computer interaction. 

Computer  professionals use their knowledge and skills to create software, develop websites, and design computer systems. They also research and analyze new technologies and methods to improve existing systems. 

The central concepts and topics  in computer science are data structures, algorithms, programming paradigms, computer architecture, operating systems and artificial intelligence.

### Computer science courses typically teach several programming languages, including but not limited to:

* **Python –** A high-level, general-purpose programming language that is often taught as an introductory programming language in computer science programs. \
  \
  It is widely used in various fields including web development, data science, machine learning, and scientific computing. \
  \
  Python is known for its ease of use, simplicity, and readability, making it an ideal language for beginners to learn.
* **Java** – It is commonly taught in computer science courses and is one of the most widely used programming languages in industry and academia. \
  It is a versatile, object-oriented language that can be used for various applications such as web development, mobile app development, desktop applications, and more. \
  \
  Java is a popular choice for beginners to learn programming as it is relatively easy to understand and has a large online community that provides support and resources.
* **C** – It is typically taught in computer science programs as a fundamental programming language. It is a low-level language that provides a strong foundation for understanding the basics of programming, and is widely used for system programming, developing operating systems, and embedded systems. \
  \
  C is also used as a starting point for learning other programming languages, such as C++, Java, and Python.
* **C++** – is a high-level, general-purpose programming language that is widely used in areas such as system software, application software, game development, and computer graphics. \
  \
  It is considered an intermediate-level language, which makes it a good choice for those who have some prior programming experience and want to expand their knowledge.
* **JavaScript** – is a commonly taught programming language in computer science courses and is considered to be one of the core web development technologies. It is a scripting language that is used to create dynamic and interactive web pages, and is a popular choice for building web applications and front-end development. \
  \
  Many computer science programs also cover front-end development frameworks such as React and Angular, which are built using JavaScript.
* **C#** – It is also often taught in computer science programs, particularly in courses that focus on the development of desktop applications, web applications, and video games. It is a modern object-oriented programming language widely used for building applications on Microsoft's .NET platform and is known for its ease of use, versatility, and support for multiple programming paradigms. \
  \
  C# is a popular choice for building Windows applications, and its strong type checking, automatic memory management, and garbage collection make it an appealing choice for many programmers.
* **Ruby – a** high-level, dynamic, object-oriented programming language used to create web applications. It is used as a teaching language to introduce concepts such as object-oriented programming.
* **Swift** – is a powerful and intuitive programming language that is commonly taught in computer science curricula, especially in the context of iOS and macOS app development. \
  \
  It is widely used by developers for building applications for Apple's platforms and has become increasingly popular in recent years.
* **SQL (Structured Query Language)** – It is often taught in computer science programs, as it is a widely used language for managing and manipulating data stored in relational databases. \
  \
  Understanding SQL is essential for many computer science and software development careers, including data analysis, web development, and database administration.
* **PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor)** – It is a server-side scripting language that is widely used for building dynamic websites and web applications. In computer science, PHP is typically taught as part of the curriculum for web development and web application development. It can also be used to build server-side applications and connect to databases.
