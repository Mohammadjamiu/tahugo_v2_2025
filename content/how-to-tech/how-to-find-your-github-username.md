[GitHub](https://github.com/) is a web-based platform designed for developers and programmers to collaborate on projects, track changes in code, and manage version control. 

It plays a crucial role in the world of software development, making it easier for teams to work together, share code, and contribute to open-source projects.

## **How Does GitHub Usernames Look Like?**

GitHub's usernames typically consist of alphanumeric characters (letters and numbers) and may include hyphens (-). 

However, they cannot start or end with a hyphen and also there cannot be spaces between the username. 

The format is not case-sensitive, meaning “MyUsername” and “myusername” are considered the same.

**Here are example list of valid GitHub usernames:**

* Mohammadjamiu
* john_doe
* code_master123
* alice-99
* my_github_user
