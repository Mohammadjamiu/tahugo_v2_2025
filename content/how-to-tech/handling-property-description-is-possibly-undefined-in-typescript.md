I was building a dynamic category page in Next.js where blog posts are displayed. Each post includes a title, image, categories, and a short description. However, when accessing the `description` property of a `post` object, I encountered the TypeScript error:\
`'post.description' is possibly 'undefined'.`

I realized this happened because TypeScript inferred that the `description` property might not always be defined for all `post` objects in the `posts` array. TypeScript, being strict about undefined properties, flagged this as a potential runtime issue.

### **How I Fixed It**

I resolved this issue by implementing a fallback mechanism for the `description` property. Here’s how I did it:

1. **Understand the Source of the Error:**\
   I examined the `posts` array structure and confirmed that not all `post` objects guaranteed the presence of a `description` field.
2. **Use the Nullish Coalescing Operator (`??`)**:\
   To provide a fallback value in case `description` is `undefined` or `null`, I updated the code as follows:

   ```tsx
   <h3 className="text-base text-muted-foreground">
     <span>
       {post.description?.length > 90
         ? `${post.description.slice(0, 90)}...`
         : post.description ?? "No description available"}
     </span>
   </h3>
   ```

   * The `?.` (optional chaining) ensures the length check is only performed if `description` is defined.
   * The `??` (nullish coalescing) operator provides a default string if `description` is `undefined` or `null`.
3. **Optional: Use a Type Guard:**\
   If preferred, I could explicitly check for the existence of the `description` property before attempting to access or manipulate it:

   ```tsx
   <h3 className="text-base text-muted-foreground">
     <span>
       {post.description
         ? post.description.length > 90
           ? `${post.description.slice(0, 90)}...`
           : post.description
         : "No description available"}
     </span>
   </h3>
   ```
4. **Test the Solution:**\
   After implementing the fallback mechanism, I ran the application and verified that:

   * Posts with a defined `description` displayed correctly.
   * Posts without a `description` showed the fallback text: “No description available.”

By following these steps, I ensured that the code handled undefined `description` values gracefully without triggering TypeScript errors or runtime crashes.
