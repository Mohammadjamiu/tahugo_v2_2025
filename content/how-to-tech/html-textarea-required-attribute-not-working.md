To make an HTML form “textarea” to have a required attribute, all you need to do is to add `required` or `required="required"`

But sometimes when you add the required attribute to force the user to input data, it does not work. Here's how to fix it.

Make sure that the `<textarea></textarea>` does not have space in between because if it does have then you have already input some character or text.

```html
<!-- Do this -->
<textarea></textarea>

<!-- Dont do this!!!!!!  -->
<textarea> </textarea>
```

> Do not forget to add the `required` attribute.

```html
<!-- Do this -->
<textarea required></textarea>

<!-- or -->

<!-- This -->
<textarea required="required" ></textarea>
```

> Another reason why you need to make sure that the `textarea` tag are closed and no space is because if you add a `placeholder` attribute it wont work.

Voilà :tada: that's all.
