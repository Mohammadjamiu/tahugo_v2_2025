## **Steps on How to Install Node.js on Windows**

### Step 1/ Check if you have Node.js already installed

If you see a version number, you're good to go. If not, proceed to the next steps to install or update Node.js.

### Step 2/ Download Node.js

If you do not have Node.js installed, then, navigate to the official Node.js website at <https://nodejs.org/en> to download the installer.

On the website, you will find multiple versions, but it's recommended to opt for the one marked as “LTS (Long-Term Support) version — recommended” for optimal performance.

A welcome page will greet you. The welcome page provides a quick overview.

### Step 7/ “Tools for Native Modules” page

On the “Tools for Native Modules” page, you have the option to select automatic installation of tools required for native modules.
