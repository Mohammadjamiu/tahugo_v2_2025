If you see a version number, you're good to go. If not, proceed to the next steps to install or update Node.js.

If you do not have Node.js installed, then, navigate to the official Node.js website at <https://nodejs.org/en> to download the installer.

On the website, you will find multiple versions, but it's recommended to opt for the one marked as ‚ÄúLTS (Long-Term Support) version ‚Äî recommended‚Äù for optimal performance.
