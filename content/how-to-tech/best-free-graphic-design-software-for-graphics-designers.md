In this post, we would be discussing on some free best graphic design software to use for design graphing as a graphic design.

## Free Graphics Design Software

1. <a href="https://inkscape.org" class="links-to-others">Inkscape</a> is an open source vector based illustrator it is a free alternative to Adobe Illustrator and offer great feature which can be used to design simple to complex design.

   Some design ideas can be done on Inkscape are business card design, e-book cover design, design of mandala art with it great flexibility, logo design, icon design and also for website mockup.

   It is available on both Mac, windows and Linux platforms.
2. <a href="https://gimp.org" class="links-to-others">Gimp</a> is another open source photo editing app similar to adobe Photoshop, and it offers comparable features with that of the features offered by Photoshop.

   It can be used to create and edit mockup, to create brochures, flyers, business cards etc.

   But a little downside to gimp is the learning curve, and it is due to the less community experienced in Gimp as opposed to Photoshop and also most designs are available in PSD format which can be edited easily in Photoshop.

   Still, I found Gimp useful as it offers some great features for free.
3. <a href="https://canva.com" class="links-to-others">Canva</a> is a design tool that has made both individuals experienced in graphic designing and those that are not to design great design with it drag and drop features. It is mostly used by online digital marketers to quickly create custom design for product advertisement.

   It has many templates that you can choose from, putting in mind that it has a paid version but still, signing up for just the free gives you almost 60% of the total benefit you can get from Canva.

   Think of any design, and it can be done in Canva such as mockup which can be difficult especially if you are not that good at using other graphic design software, to create business card, e-books, advert banner etc.

   It is available on both Mac, windows and Android and iOS platforms.
4. <a href="https://blender.org" class="links-to-others">Blender</a> is an open source software which is mostly used for making 3D and 2D animations, rending and motion design.

   It has an ever-growing community where users learn more on how to use blender. Because blender is a free tool does not mean it is not used by even big companies designing animations.

   The learning curve is a bit tedious, and it is not ideal for beginners, but if you can exercise patience then you can be an expert at using Blender.

   It is available on both Mac, windows and Linux platforms.
