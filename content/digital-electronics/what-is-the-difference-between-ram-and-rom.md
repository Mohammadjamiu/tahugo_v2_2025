**RAM** which stands for _Random Access Memory_ and **ROM** which stands for _Read Only Memory_ are the major categories or types of semiconductor memories.

RAM is responsible for storing or holding data which are temporary and can be erased when power is lost hence it is called volatile memory while ROM stores data permanently and can hold data even if power is turned off hence it is non-volatile.

## Difference Between RAM and ROM

</br>

### RAM

1. RAM stands for Random Access Memory.

1. RAM is a read/write memory.

1. Data are stored temporarily in RAM.

1. RAM is a volatile memory as it loses stored data when there is no power supply.

1. Data in RAM can be modified.

1. Data in RAM can be directly accessed by the CPU (Central Processing Unit).

1. RAM is faster than ROM in terms of speed.

1. There are two types of RAM – SRAM (Static RAM) and DRAM (Dynamic RAM).

1. RAM is expensive or costlier.

1. RAM has a larger data size capability.

1. RAM can store data up to several Gigabytes.

### ROM

1. ROM stands for Read Only Memory.

1. ROM is a read memory as oppose to RAM which is a Read/Write Memory.

1. Data are stored permanently in ROM.

1. ROM is a non-volatile memory as it retains the stored data when there is no power supply
   .
1. Data in ROM cannot be modified.

1. Data in ROM cannot be directly accessed by the CPU (Central Processing Unit) rather data in ROM is copied to the RAM.

1. ROM is slower than RAM in terms of speed.

1. There are five types of ROM – Mask ROM (or just ROM), Programmable ROM (PROM), Erasable Programmable ROM (EPROM), Ultraviolet EPROM (UV EPROM) and Electrically Erasable PROM (EEPROM).

1. ROM is less expensive or cheaper.

1. ROM has a smaller data size capability.

1. ROM can store data up to several Megabytes.
