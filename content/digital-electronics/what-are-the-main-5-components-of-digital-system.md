**A digital system** is a system that deals with digital signals. These signals are composed of binary digits or “bits,” which are represented by 0s and 1s. These 0's and 1's denotes an **OFF** and **ON** state. Digital signals are used to represent a wide range of information, such as text, images, sounds, and videos.

In simpler terms, think of digital signals as a language that computers and other digital devices use, to communicate with each other. Just like how humans use language to communicate ideas and information, digital signals are used by computers to process and communicate information in a digital format.

For example, when you type a letter on a keyboard, the input is transformed into a digital signal composed of 0s and 1s that the computer can understand. 

The digital signal is then processed by the computer's central processing unit (CPU), which manipulates the signal according to the instructions given by the software. The output is then presented on a screen as text, images, or other types of media.

Understanding how digital systems work is essential in today's world, as they are used in various devices such as smartphones, computers, and other electronic gadgets. By knowing how digital signals are processed and manipulated, you can better understand how these devices operate and communicate with each other.

## What Are the Main 5 Components of Digital System?

Digital systems are made up of various components that work together to process and manipulate digital signals. Here are the five main components of a digital system and their functions:

1. Input devices
2. Processing units
3. Memory
4. Output devices
5. Communication channels



### **1/ Input Devices**

**Input devices** are devices that allow users to input information into the digital system. These can include devices like keyboards, mice, scanners, microphones, and sensors. 

For example, a keyboard allows users to input text, while a scanner allows users to input images or documents.

### **2/ Processing Units**

**Processing units** are the core of the digital system, where the actual processing of data takes place. They can include CPUs (Central Processing Units), GPUs (Graphics Processing Units), and other specialized processors. 

The processing unit carries out arithmetic and logical operations on the digital signals to perform various tasks. For example, a CPU might be used to perform calculations, while a GPU might be used to render graphics.

### **3/ Memory**

**Memory** is used to store digital signals temporarily or permanently. There are two types of memory in digital systems: volatile and non-volatile. 

Volatile memory, such as RAM (Random Access Memory), stores data temporarily and is lost when power is turned off. Non-volatile memory, such as ROM (Read-Only Memory) and hard disk drives, stores data permanently. 

For example, RAM might be used to temporarily store the contents of a web page, while a hard disk drive might be used to permanently store a document.

### **4/ Output Devices** 

**Output devices** are devices that allow users to view or output information from the digital system. These can include devices like monitors, printers, speakers, and projectors. 

Output devices convert digital signals into physical signals, such as light or sound, that can be perceived by humans. For example, a monitor might be used to display a web page, while a printer might be used to print a document.

### **5/ Communication Channels**

**Communication channels** are used to transmit digital signals between different components of the digital system or between different systems. They can include physical channels, such as cables and wires, or wireless channels, such as radio waves or infrared signals. 

Communication channels allow digital systems to communicate with other systems and exchange data. 

For example, a network cable might be used to connect a computer to the internet, while a wireless signal might be used to connect a smartphone to a Wi-Fi network.
