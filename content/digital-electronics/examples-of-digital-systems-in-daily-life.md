## **What are digital systems?**

**Digital systems** are electronic systems that use digital signals composed of binary digits or “bits” (0s and 1s) to process and manipulate information. 

They are made up of various components, including input devices, processing units, memory, output devices, and communication channels, that work together to perform various tasks. 

Digital systems have become an integral part of our daily lives, and there are countless examples of their applications in various fields. 

Some popular examples of digital systems in daily life include:

* Electric stoves, pressure cookers, and tea/coffee machines: These are kitchen appliances that use digital controls to operate.
* Traffic lights: These are systems used to control traffic flow at intersections and other locations.
* Digital signature pads: Used in many industries to capture digital signatures for verification or authorization purposes.
* Motion sensors: Used in security systems or home automation to detect movement.
* GPS navigation devices: Devices that use GPS technology to provide real-time navigation information.
* Smartwatches and digital wristwatches: These are wearable devices that provide information such as time, fitness tracking, or notifications.
* Fire alarms and carbon monoxide detectors: These are devices that use sensors to detect smoke or dangerous gases and alert people to potential danger.
* Electronic safes: These are devices that use digital locks to secure valuables or other items.
* Robotic vacuum cleaners: These are autonomous devices that use sensors to navigate and clean floors without human intervention.
* Automobile systems: These include a wide range of systems that use digital technology to operate, including anti-lock brakes, cruise control, in-vehicle entertainment systems, and more.
* Washing machines and dishwashers: These are household appliances that use digital controls to operate.
* Parking lot ticket machines: Used in parking garages and lots to issue and validate parking tickets.
* Wi-Fi routers: These are devices that create wireless networks to connect digital devices to the internet.
* Vending machines: These are machines that dispense food, drinks, or other items and use digital technology to operate.
* Printers, photocopy, fax machines and scanners: These are digital devices used to create, duplicate, or send paper
* Home security systems: These systems use digital systems for monitoring and control of the security of a home, including alarms, cameras, and remote access.
* Lighting systems: These systems use digital systems for controlling lighting levels, timers, and automation.
* Electronic parking meters and parking pay stations: These devices use digital systems to manage parking fees and accept payments.
* Digital and video cameras: These devices use digital systems to capture and store images and videos.
* CD players, iPods, and MP3 players: These devices use digital systems to store, play, and manage digital music files.
* Heart rate monitors and pacemakers: These medical devices use digital systems to monitor and regulate heart rate.
* Remote control gate keys: These devices use digital systems for remote access to gates and garages.
* Cash registers: These devices use digital systems to manage sales transactions and inventory.
* PDAs and hand-held computers: These devices use digital systems for mobile computing and communication.
* Air-conditioners and thermostats: These devices use digital systems to control temperature and climate.
* Refrigerators and freezers: These appliances use digital systems for temperature regulation and management.
* Calculators: These devices use digital systems to perform arithmetic calculations.
