In the digital world, computers use the binary system, which consists of only two digits: 0 and 1. In contrast, humans primarily utilize the decimal system, with ten digits from 0 to 9. 

Converting binary numbers to decimal allows us to interpret and work with binary data in a format that is more familiar to us. 

It is an essential skill for programmers, computer scientists, and anyone dealing with binary data.

## **Understanding Binary and Decimal Number Systems**

Before we dive into the conversion process, let's gain a basic understanding of the binary and decimal number systems. 

In the decimal system, each digit's place value represents a power of 10. The rightmost digit corresponds to $10^0$ (1), the next digit represents $10^1$ (10), followed by $10^2$ (100), and so on. 

In binary, the place values are powers of 2. The rightmost digit represents $2^0$ (1), the next digit represents $2^1$ (2), then $2^2$ (4), and so forth.

## **How to Convert Binary to Decimal Step-by-Step**

Now, let's look at the step-by-step process of converting binary numbers to decimal.

### **Step 1: Assigning Place Values**

Begin by assigning place values to each digit in the binary number, starting from the rightmost digit. 

The rightmost digit will have a place value of $2^0$ (1), the next digit to the left will have a place value of $2^1$ (2), the next digit will have $2^2$ (4), and so on.

### **Step 2: Calculating the Decimal Equivalent**

Multiply each digit in the binary number by its corresponding place value and sum up the results. This calculation will give you the decimal equivalent of the binary number.

### **Step 3: Finalizing the Conversion**

After calculating the decimal equivalent, you have successfully converted the binary number to decimal. 

The decimal number represents the same value as the original binary number but in the decimal number system.

## **Examples of How to Convert a Binary Number to Decimal**

### **Example 1: Convert the binary number, 10110 to decimal**

Step 1: Assigning Place Values:

```mathematica
  1        0        1        1        0  

 2^4   2^3   2^2   2^1   2^0
  16      0       4        2        0
```

Step 2: Calculating the Decimal Equivalent:

```
1 * 16 + 0 * 0 + 1 * 4 + 1 * 2 + 0 * 1 = 22
```

Therefore, the binary number, 10110 is equal to 22 in decimal.

### **Example 2: Convert the binary number, 110011 to decimal.**

Step 1: Assigning Place Values:

```mathematica
 1        1        0        0        1        1
     
2^5   2^4   2^3   2^2   2^1   2^0
 32      16      0       0       2       1
```

Step 2: Calculating the Decimal Equivalent:

```
1 * 32 + 1 * 16 + 0 * 0 + 0 * 0 + 1 * 2 + 1 * 1 = 51
```

Hence, the binary number, 110011 is equal to 51 in decimal.

### **Example 3: Convert the Binary 1101 to Decimal**

Step 1: Assigning Place Values:

```mathematica
1        1        0        1
   
2^3   2^2   2^1   2^0
8       4       0       1
```

Step 2: Calculating the Decimal Equivalent:

```
1 * 8 + 1 * 4 + 0 * 0 + 1 * 1 = 13
```

Therefore, the binary number 1101 is equal to 13 in decimal.

### **Example 4: Convert the Binary 10010 to Decimal**

Step 1: Assigning Place Values:

```mathematica
1        0        0        1        0

2^4   2^3   2^2   2^1   2^0
16      0       0       2       0
```

Step 2: Calculating the Decimal Equivalent:

```
1 * 16 + 0 * 0 + 0 * 0 + 1 * 2 + 0 * 1 = 18
```

Hence, the binary number 10010 is equal to 18 in decimal.

### **Example 5: Convert the Binary 111111 to Decimal**

Step 1: Assigning Place Values:

```mathematica
1        1        1        1        1        1
   
 2^5   2^4   2^3   2^2   2^1   2^0
 32      16      8        4       2       1
```

Step 2: Calculating the Decimal Equivalent:

```
1 * 32 + 1 * 16 + 1 * 8 + 1 * 4 + 1 * 2 + 1 * 1 = 63
```

Therefore, the binary number 111111 is equal to 63 in decimal.

### **Example 6: Converting Binary 10101 to Decimal**

Step 1: Assigning Place Values:

```mathematica
1        0        1        0        1

2^4   2^3   2^2   2^1   2^0
16      0     4     0     1
```

Step 2: Calculating the Decimal Equivalent: 

```
1 * 16 + 0 * 0 + 1 * 4 + 0 * 0 + 1 * 1 = 21
```

Hence, the binary number 10101 is equal to 21 in decimal.

### **Example 7: Convert the Binary, 1100100 to Decimal**

64      32      0       0       4       2       0
```

   Step 2: Calculating the Decimal Equivalent:

```
1 * 64 + 1 * 32 + 0 * 0 + 0 * 0 + 1 * 4 + 0  *2 + 0*  1 = 100
```

Therefore, the binary number, 1100100 is equal to 100 in decimal.

## **Advantages of Binary and Decimal Number Systems**
