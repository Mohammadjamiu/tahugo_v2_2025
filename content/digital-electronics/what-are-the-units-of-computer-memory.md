Computers only understands zero’s and one’s which represent off and on. This zero’s and one’s are called binary digits or bits for short.

This means that a bit consists of a zero and a one. This bit is the smallest unit of computer memory unit.

## What is computer memory units?

**A computer memory unit** is the measure of memory or storage which is used to represent data.

Like the example of on and off which is a binary digit 0 and 1. The more the data the more the zero’s and one’s.

## Computer memory units

Here is the list of memory units of computer.

1. **Binary Digit (Bit)**

   Bit is derived from Binary Digit by taking the first two letters in binary (Bi) and then joining it with the last letter in digit which is (t). Bit as we state earlier is the smallest unit and it is composed of 2 digits (0 and 1).

1. **Nibble**

   A nibble is composed of 4 bits (i.e. 4 zeros and ones).

1. **Word**

   Word is a unit just as byte which indicate the memory unit occupied by a certain chunk of data. This chunk of data has a fixed size which cannot be altered during the process of execution.

1. **Byte**

   Byte is often the unit used to represent data as it made up of 8 bits. This means that 2 nibble is a byte.

1. **Kilobyte**

   A Kilobyte is denoted as (KB) and it is made up of 1024 bytes

   or (1024 X 8 bits).

1. **Megabyte**

   A Megabyte is denoted as (MB) and it is made up of 1024 Kilobytes

   or (1024 X 1024 X 8 bits).

1. **Gigabyte**

   A Gigabyte is denoted as (GB) and it is made up of 1024 Megabytes

   or (1024 X 1024 X 1024 X 8 bits).

1. **Terabyte**

   A Terabyte is denoted as (TB) and it is made up of 1024 Gigabytes

   or (1024 X 1024 X 1024 X 1024 X 8 bits).

1. **Petabyte**

   A Petabyte is denoted as (PB) and it is made up of 1024 Terabytes

   or (1024 X 1024 X 1024 X 1024 X 1024 X 8 bits).

1. **Exabyte**

   An Exabyte is denoted as (EB) and it is made up of 1024 Petabytes

   or (1024 X 1024 X 1024 X 1024 X 1024 X 1024 X 8 bits).

1. **Zettabyte**

   A Zettabyte is denoted as (ZB) and it is made up of 1024 Exabyte

   or (1024 X 1024 X 1024 X 1024 X 1024 X 1024 X 1024 X 8 bits).

1. **Yottabyte**

   A Yottabyte is denoted as (YB) and it is made up of 1024 Zettabytes

   or (1024 X 1024 X 1024 X 1024 X 1024 X 1024 X 1024 X 1024 X 8 bits).

Among all the listed units, Kilobytes, Megabytes, Gigabytes, Terabytes and petabytes are the most common unit used in representing a memory or storage capacity of a computer.

## Computer memory unit chart for common units

| Units           | Description |
| :-------------- | :---------- |
| 1 Byte          | 8 bits      |
| 1 Kilobyte (KB) | 1024 Bytes  |
| 1 Megabyte (MB) | 1024 KB     |
| 1 Gigabyte (GB) | 1024 MB     |
| 1 Terabyte (TB) | 1024 GB     |
| 1 Petabyte (PB) | 1024 TB     |
