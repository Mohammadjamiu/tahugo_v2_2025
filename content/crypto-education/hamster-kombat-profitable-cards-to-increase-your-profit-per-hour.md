The Hamster Kombat team made a statement on their Telegram channel and Twitter (X) that the airdrop for those mining Hamster Kombat tokens will depend on the profit per hour and some other activity parameters that they will reveal later, but not the coin balance.

Note: this does not mean that you should burn all your coin balance in an attempt to increase your profit per hour because you will be left with no coins. 

Consequently, you won't be able to claim the daily combo cards, which might require a significant number of coins to unlock.

With that said, here are some of the profitable cards we have identified on Hamster Kombat to help boost or maximize your profit per hour.
