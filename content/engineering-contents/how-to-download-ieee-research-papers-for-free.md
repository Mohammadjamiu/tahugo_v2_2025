It's quite obvious that in today's information age, access to research papers is crucial for academic and professional success and growth.

However, many research papers, especially those published in IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) journals and conferences, often come with subscription that requires one to pay.

But what if you could access and download these valuable resources for free?

In this article, we will look at how to download IEEE research papers for free.

## **Steps on How to Download IEEE Research Papers for Free**

### Step 1: Visit the IEEE Explore Site Library

To kick-start your journey to accessing IEEE research papers for free, the first step is to visit the [IEEE Explore Site](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/home.jsp) Library.

### Step 2: Search for the Paper Name

Once you're on the IEEE Explore site, use the search bar to look for the paper you're interested in.

You can search by the paper's title, keywords, or the author's name.

The more specific your search query, the easier it will be to locate your desired paper.

### Step 3: Locate the DOI Section

After finding the paper you need, open it and scroll down to locate the DOI (Digital Object Identifier) section.

> As you can see, access is needed to download the paper - but don't worry we are going to get it for free.

The DOI is a unique alphanumeric code assigned to each academic paper, making it easy to access the paper online.

Now that you've found the DOI, highlight and copy the code.

### Step 4: Visit Sci-Hub

To access the IEEE research paper for free, you'll need to head over to [Sci-Hub](https://sci-hub.se/).

Sci-Hub is a platform that provides free access to millions of research papers, bypassing paywalls and subscription requirements.

It allows one to download not only IEEE research papers for free but also research papers from Wiley, ScienceDirect, Springer and others.

### Step 5: Paste the DOI Code

Once you're on Sci-Hub's website, you'll find an available box.

Paste the DOI code you copied from the IEEE Explore site library into this box.

Then, click the “Open” button.

### Step 6: Access and Download the Paper

To download the paper, simply click on the “Save” button located on the left side of the screen.
