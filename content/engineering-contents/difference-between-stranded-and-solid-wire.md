When it comes to electrical wiring, the choice of wire type can be as critical as the wiring itself.

Stranded wire and solid wire are the two primary options, each with its own set of characteristics and applications.

In this article, we will look at the difference between the two.

## **What Is Stranded Wire?**

Stranded wire, presents a more complex structure. It consists of multiple thin wires twisted together into a bundle, rendering it highly flexible and delicate. 

This flexibility makes stranded wire the go-to choice for applications requiring bending and twisting, such as car doors.

**Advantages of Stranded Wire:**

* Stranded wires are highly flexible and can be easily bent to fit various applications.
* These wires are malleable, making them adaptable to different shapes and configurations.
* Stranded wires are known for their delicate nature, which is often beneficial in applications requiring fine or intricate wiring.



Stranded wire's flexibility and versatility make it suitable for indoor applications, where its primary concern is flexibility. 

It's commonly found in circuit boards, computers, car wiring, electrical machinery, and more. 

However, stranded wires are relatively more complex and can be affected by adverse weather conditions.

## **What Is Solid Wire?**

Solid wire, as its name suggests, comprises a single, unbroken conductor typically crafted from solid copper or another metal. 

This wire type boasts robustness and is ideal for applications demanding high current capacity, minimal movement, and extended lifespan.

**Advantages of Solid Wire:**

* Solid wires are resilient in various weather conditions, making them suitable for outdoor use.
* These wires are known for their long-lasting performance and ability to withstand wear and tear.
* Solid wires have a natural resistance to corrosion, ensuring a longer lifespan.
* They are cost-effective and offer good value for various electrical applications.

Solid wires find their place in various applications, including building infrastructures, outdoor and heavy-duty settings, and vehicle controls, among others. 

However, it's worth noting that solid wires tend to be heavier due to their construction.

## **Key Differences Between Stranded and Solid Wires**

Here is a table showing the main differences between stranded and solid wires:
